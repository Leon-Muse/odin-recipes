    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Easter is less than 1 week away and if you’re anything like me, 
            easy appetizers are always a must. And they’re especially needed if you 
            can make them ahead of time too! That’s why I just had to share these 
            incredibly easy garlic knots to add to your Easter spread. It’s not only 
            foolproof but this would also be so fun to make with your little ones because 
            if they’re anything like my niece and nephews, playing with dough is the 
        greatest “toy” of all!
         </p>

         <p>So how does this come together? Simply halve each serving of biscuit dough
            ,roll them out to about 5-6 inches, tie them into a knot, and slather on 
            that buttery goodness. From there, you’ll just pop them right into the oven
            and brush on some more butter to taste. The more the better, right?
