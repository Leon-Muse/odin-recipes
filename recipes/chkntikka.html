        rivals any Indian restaurant! Why go out when you can make it better

        <p>The BEST part about this recipe and just like our Butter Chicken 
            — you may already have these ingredients in your kitchen. 
            If not, they are so easy to find in any grocery store, you won’t need to go 
            searching high and low to find them! Authentic Chicken Tikka Masala is usually 
            made with yogurt marinated chicken, skewered and chargrilled for incredible bbq 
            flavours. For the sake of making this recipe much easier for us to make at 
            home, we are using a skillet or pot to cook it all in, while still keeping those 
            amazing flavours.
